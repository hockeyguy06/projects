# Project Analysis: Apple Stock Analysis (1980-2022)

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the future stock prices of Apple Inc. based on historical stock data. By employing different Machine Learning models like Random Forest Classification, Neural Network Architectures and Linear Regression, the project aims to create a predictive model that can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions regarding Apple's stock.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis covers the following key areas:

1. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the dataset to understand the structure of Apple's stock prices, including date, opening, closing, high, low prices, and trading volume.

2. **Data Visualization**: Creating line plots and scatter plots to visualize trends, price patterns, and trading volume fluctuations to predict Apple's future stock prices.

3. **Summary Statistics**: Calculating Relative Strength Index, Daily Returns, and other summary statistics to understand the central tendency and variability of Apple's stock prices.

4. **Moving Averages**: Computing 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify long-term trends and potential support/resistance levels.

5. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the correlation between the actual stock price and the predicted stock price to understand the relationship between the model and Apple's stock prices.


## Methodologies Used

The analysis employs the following methodologies:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
- Data visualization using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Calculation of summary statistics using NumPy.
- Calculation of moving averages for trend analysis.
- Correlation analysis to assess the relationship between Apple's actual stock prices and predicted stock prices.

## How to Repeat the Analysis
